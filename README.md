"Combating False Information: Using Machine Learning and Flask Framework to Scrape Fact and Fake News in Pakistani News Websites"

In today's digital age, the spread of false information has become a significant concern. With the proliferation of news websites and social media, it's becoming increasingly challenging to differentiate between real and fake news. In response to this growing problem, a project was undertaken to scrape fact and fake news articles from Pakistani news websites using advanced machine learning techniques and the Flask framework.

The project aimed to collect and scrape data sets from different news channels such as Geo News, Samma News, Daily Pakistan News, and Dunya News, among others. The project was able to collect 55,000 sample data sets, which were then cleaned and used to build models using machine learning algorithms.

Through extensive training and tuning of different models, the team was able to achieve an accuracy of 84% with the Logistic Regression Model. This result is particularly noteworthy considering that this was an unsupervised learning problem and highlights the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in solving complex problems like this.

With the successful completion of the project, the team was able to create a model file ready for deployment using HTML and the Flask framework. The deployment of the model was done using a web-based interface, making it easy to use and accessible to a wide range of users. The model was then tested with real and unseen data sets using articles from different sources. The results showed that the model was capable of correctly identifying the veracity of news articles with a high degree of accuracy, demonstrating the power of machine learning in solving this problem.

This project highlights the importance of combating false information and the role that machine learning and web-based technologies like Flask can play in achieving this goal. The deployment of this model can be a valuable tool for journalists, researchers, and the general public in verifying the accuracy of news articles. With the growing threat of misinformation, initiatives like these are crucial in maintaining the credibility of news sources and promoting an informed society.
